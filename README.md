# athletic-support-styles
Changes to this repo trigger an automatic Netlify build that enables us to easily update styles for support.athletic.net as well as keep a historical record of style changes.

## How to create a new styles file
1. Create new file ending in `.css` in the repo root
2. Save changes directly to the master branch (this will automatically trigger a Netlify deploy)
3. You'll find your .css file at https://athletic-support-styles.netlify.app/YOUR-NAME.css

## How to update a styles file
1. Edit a current .css file and save directly to master branch if confident you are happy with the changes. If you'd like someone else to review your changes before deploying them, create a pull request and request a review from the appropriate person.
2. Changes are live.
