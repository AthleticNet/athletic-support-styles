      Accept electronic payments online
    </div>
    <p>
      Athletic.net has partnered with Stripe to collect credit card payments. Stripe is the payment processor behind some of the largest businesses online, and uses state-of-the-art security systems to ensure your payment data is safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small processing fee applies to each credit card transaction. You can choose to pay these fees out of what you collect, or pass the fees onto your customers. It's a small price to pay for the convenience, but if you prefer to receive checks or cash, we'll still provide all fee calculation and invoicing services. <a class="chevron-rightl05 ml05" target="_blank" href="/article/isyzpgnjqu-athletic-net-financial-feature-policies">
